# Simple TCP Server

This project is a simple TCP server implementation. It allows clients to connect to the server using TCP/IP and exchange data. The server listens for incoming connections, accepts client requests, and handles data transmission.

## Files

- `server.py`: This file contains the main implementation of the TCP server. It sets up the server socket, listens for incoming connections, and handles client requests.
- `client.py`: This file provides a sample client implementation that can connect to the server and send/receive data.

## Usage

To use the Simple TCP Server, follow these steps:

1. Run the `server.py` file to start the server.
2. Run the `client.py` file to start a client and connect to the server.
3. Use the client to send and receive data from the server.
